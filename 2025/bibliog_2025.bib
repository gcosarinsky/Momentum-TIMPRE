	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is a well-established clinical imaging technique providing real-time, quantitative anatomical and physiological information in humans. The lack of ionizing radiation and relative low purchase and maintenance costs results in it being one of the most frequently used clinical imaging techniques with increasing use for guiding interventional clinical procedures. Until 20 years ago, translation of clinical ultrasound practices to preclinical applications proved a significant technological challenge due to the smaller size (25g vs. 70 kg) and rapid conscious heart-rate (500–700 bpm vs. 60 bpm) of the mouse requiring an increase in both spatial and temporal resolution of 10–20-fold in order to achieve diagnostic information comparable to that achieved clinically. Since 2000 [1], these technological challenges have been overcome and commercial high frequency ultrasound scanners have enabled longitudinal studies of disease progression in small animal models to be undertaken. Adult, neonatal and embryonic rats, mice and zebrafish can now be scanned with resolutions down to 30 microns and with sufficient temporal resolution to enable cardiac abnormalities in all these species to be identified. In mice and rats, quantification of blood flow in cardiac chambers, renal, liver and uterine vessels, and intra-mural tissue movements can be obtained using the Doppler technique. Ultrasonic contrast microbubbles used routinely for clinical applications are now being further developed to include targeting mechanisms and drug-loading capabilities and the results in animal models bode well for translation for targeted drug delivery in humans}

	abstract = {Molecular imaging has emerged at the end of the last century as an interdisciplinary method involving in vivo imaging and molecular biology aiming at identifying living biological processes at a cellular and molecular level in a noninvasive manner. It has a profound role in determining disease changes and facilitating drug research and development, thus creating new medical modalities to monitor human health. At present, a variety of different molecular imaging techniques have their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. In order to overcome these shortcomings, researchers combine two or more detection techniques to create a new imaging mode, such as multimodal molecular imaging, to obtain a better result and more information regarding monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we first describe the classic molecular imaging technology and its key advantages, and then, we offer some of the latest multimodal molecular imaging modes. Finally, we summarize the great challenges, the future development, and the great potential in this fiel}

	abstract = {Preclinical research utilizing animal models is a crucial part of biomedical science, serving to investigate and validate new biomarkers, imaging agents, and therapeutic interventions prior to clinical trial initiation. An extensive variety of animal models is available, effectively replicating various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, and inflammatory conditions. Nuclear medicine molecular imaging offers three-dimensional, functional visualization of biological activity within living organisms through the use of radioactive tracers, revealing how these processes are spatially distributed in both animal models and human bodies. The present chapter deals with the potentials offered by the wide range of available scanners for pre-clinical molecular imaging discussing PET and SPECT/CT imaging, PET/MRI as well as optical imaging. Although these systems share some features with their clinical counterparts, significant adjustments are necessary to appropriately scale down clinical imaging technologies for preclinical applications. Preclinical PET scanners must achieve a much higher spatial resolution than clinical systems, given the considerably smaller dimensions of anatomical structures in small animals. Additionally, preclinical systems necessitate superior temporal resolution in order to register physiological processes with greater precision. Specific chapters are dedicated to preclinical imaging acquisitions for evaluation of drug delivery systems, targeting and biodistribution assessment, monitoring drug activity and interaction, evaluation of drug delivery systems, targeting and biodistribution, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, theranostics. A large part of the chapter will be thus dedicated to preclinical imaging acquisition in oncology but non-oncological applications will be also addressed. Data regarding the application of Artificial Intelligence to preclinical imaging analysis are also summarized.}

	abstract = {Background and aim: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly preferred over other more invasive modalities in preclinical studies using animal models. However, this technique has some limitations, mainly related to operator dependence. To overcome some of the current drawbacks, sophisticated data processing models are proposed, in particular artificial intelligence models based on deep learning (DL) networks. This systematic review aims to overview the application of DL algorithms in assisting US analysis of images acquired in in vivo preclinical studies on animal models.
	Methods: A literature search was conducted using the Scopus and PubMed databases. Studies published from January 2012 to November 2022 that developed DL models on US images acquired in preclinical/animal experimental scenarios were eligible for inclusion. This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines.
	Results: Fifty-six studies were enrolled and classified into five groups based on the anatomical district in which the DL models were used. Sixteen studies focused on the cardiovascular system and fourteen on the abdominal organs. Five studies applied DL networks to images of the musculoskeletal system and eight investigations involved the brain. Thirteen papers, grouped under a miscellaneous category, proposed heterogeneous applications adopting DL systems. Our analysis also highlighted that murine models were the most common animals used in in vivo studies applying DL to US imaging.
	Conclusion: DL techniques show great potential in terms of US images acquired in preclinical studies using animal models. However, in this scenario, these techniques are still in their early stages, and there is room for improvement, such as sample sizes, data preprocessing, and model interpretability.

	abstract = {A new approach for vascular super-resolution (SR) imaging using the erythrocytes as targets (SUper-Resolution ultrasound imaging of Erythrocytes (SURE) imaging) is described and investigated. SURE imaging does not require fragile contrast agent bubbles, making it possible to use the maximum allowable mechanical index (MI) for ultrasound scanning for an increased penetration depth. A synthetic aperture (SA) ultrasound sequence was employed with 12 virtual sources (VSs) using a 10-MHz GE L8-18i-D linear array hockey stick probe. The axial resolution was 1.20λ (185.0 μ m) and the lateral resolution was 1.50λ (231.3 μ m). Field IIpro simulations were conducted on 12.5- μ m radius vessel pairs with varying separations. A vessel pair with a separation of 70 μ m could be resolved, indicating a SURE image resolution below half a wavelength. A Verasonics research scanner was used for the in vivo experiments to scan the kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats for up to 46 s to visualize their microvasculature by processing from 0.1 up to 45 s of data for SURE imaging and for 46.8 s for SR imaging with a SonoVue contrast agent. Afterward, the renal vasculature was filled with the ex vivo micro-computed tomography (CT) contrast agent Microfil, excised, and scanned in a micro-CT scanner at both a 22.6- μ m voxel size for 11 h and for 20 h in a 5- μ m voxel size for validating the SURE images. Comparing the SURE and micro-CT images revealed that vessels with a diameter of 28 μ m, five times smaller than the ultrasound wavelength, could be detected, and the dense grid of microvessels in the full kidney was shown for scan times between 1 and 10 s. The vessel structure in the cortex was also similar to the SURE and SR images. Fourier ring correlation (FRC) indicated a resolution capability of 29 μ m. SURE images are acquired in seconds rather than minutes without any patient preparation or contrast injection, making the method translatable to clinical use.}

	abstract = {Chronic wounds are a major health problem that cause the medical infrastructure billions of dollars every year. Chronic wounds are often difficult to heal and cause significant discomfort. Although wound specialists have numerous therapeutic modalities at their disposal, tools that could three dimensional-map wound bed physiology and guide therapy do not exist. Visual cues are the current standard but are limited to surface assessment; clinicians rely on experience to predict response to therapy. Photoacoustic (PA) ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive, hybrid imaging modality that can solve these major limitations. PA relies on the contrast generated by haemoglobin in blood which allows it to map local angiogenesis, tissue perfusion and oxygen saturation-all critical parameters for wound healing. This work evaluates the use of PA-US to monitor angiogenesis and stratify patients responding versus not-responding to therapy. We imaged 19 patients with 22 wounds once a week for at least 3 weeks. Our findings suggest that PA imaging directly visualises angiogenesis. Patients responding to therapy showed clear signs of angiogenesis and an increased rate of PA increase (p = 0.002). These responders had a significant and negative correlation between PA intensity and wound size. Hypertension was correlated to impaired angiogenesis in non-responsive patients. The rate of PA increase and hence the rate of angiogenesis was able to predict healing times within 30 days from the start of monitoring (power = 88%, alpha = 0.05). This early response detection system could help inform management and treatment strategies while improving outcomes and reducing costs.}

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radiolabeled glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) is used to monitor atherosclerosis in clinical trials, but there is uncertainty regarding the plaque cell types that accumulate FDG and how uptake is regulated. The long-standing view that 18FDG is mainly taken up by macrophages is at odds with human and experimental data, and the impact of disease activity on 18FDG uptake has not been examined directly. To analyze the ability of 18FDG-PET to monitor disease activity, we developed a model of plaque regression in minipigs with hepatic overexpression of a gain-of-function mutant of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Atherosclerosis was induced through 12 months of high-fat feeding in the porcine model. Disease activity was then lowered for 3 months by reducing plasma cholesterol with a low-fat diet alone or in combination with the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor BMS-212122. Plaque regression in advanced lesions of the abdominal aorta was evident from reduced lipid content, reduced necrotic core size, and partial resolution of plaque inflammation and was accompanied by a decline in 18FDG-PET signal. Single-cell gene expression profiling revealed that plaque regression involved substantial down-regulation of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages, and lymphocytes, which was corroborated by analysis of the plaque cellular proteome. These findings in a large-animal model suggest that 18FDG-PET can monitor atherosclerosis because of a close association between disease activity and glycolytic enzyme expression in all of the major plaque cell types.}

Ultrasound has long been used for carotid atherosclerosis screening and plaque assessment due to its safety, low cost and non-invasive nature. However, conventional ultrasound techniques have limitations such as subjectivity, operator dependence, and low inter-observer agreement, leading to inconsistent and possibly inaccurate diagnoses. In recent years, a promising approach to address these limitations has emerged through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into ultrasound imaging. It was found that by training AI algorithms with large data sets of ultrasound images, the technology can learn to recognize specific characteristics and patterns associated with vulnerable plaques. This allows for a more objective and consistent assessment, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. This article reviews the application of AI in the field of diagnostic ultrasound, with a particular focus on carotid vulnerable plaques, and discusses the limitations and prospects of AI-assisted ultrasound. This review also provides a deeper understanding of the role of AI in diagnostic ultrasound and promotes more research in the field.}
