	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is a well-established clinical imaging technique providing real-time, quantitative anatomical and physiological information in humans. The lack of ionizing radiation and relative low purchase and maintenance costs results in it being one of the most frequently used clinical imaging techniques with increasing use for guiding interventional clinical procedures. Until 20 years ago, translation of clinical ultrasound practices to preclinical applications proved a significant technological challenge due to the smaller size (25g vs. 70 kg) and rapid conscious heart-rate (500–700 bpm vs. 60 bpm) of the mouse requiring an increase in both spatial and temporal resolution of 10–20-fold in order to achieve diagnostic information comparable to that achieved clinically. Since 2000 [1], these technological challenges have been overcome and commercial high frequency ultrasound scanners have enabled longitudinal studies of disease progression in small animal models to be undertaken. Adult, neonatal and embryonic rats, mice and zebrafish can now be scanned with resolutions down to 30 microns and with sufficient temporal resolution to enable cardiac abnormalities in all these species to be identified. In mice and rats, quantification of blood flow in cardiac chambers, renal, liver and uterine vessels, and intra-mural tissue movements can be obtained using the Doppler technique. Ultrasonic contrast microbubbles used routinely for clinical applications are now being further developed to include targeting mechanisms and drug-loading capabilities and the results in animal models bode well for translation for targeted drug delivery in humans}

At present, a variety of different molecular imaging techniques have their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. In order to overcome these shortcomings, researchers combine two or more detection techniques to create a new imaging mode, such as multimodal molecular imaging, to obtain a better result and more information regarding monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment.

An extensive variety of animal models is available, effectively replicating various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, and inflammatory conditions. Nuclear medicine molecular imaging offers three-dimensional, functional visualization of biological activity within living organisms through the use of radioactive tracers, revealing how these processes are spatially distributed in both animal models and human bodies. The present chapter deals with the potentials offered by the wide range of available scanners for pre-clinical molecular imaging discussing PET and SPECT/CT imaging, PET/MRI as well as optical imaging. Although these systems share some features with their clinical counterparts, significant adjustments are necessary to appropriately scale down clinical imaging technologies for preclinical applications. Preclinical PET scanners must achieve a much higher spatial resolution than clinical systems, given the considerably smaller dimensions of anatomical structures in small animals. Additionally, preclinical systems necessitate superior temporal resolution in order to register physiological processes with greater precision. Specific chapters are dedicated to preclinical imaging acquisitions for evaluation of drug delivery systems, targeting and biodistribution assessment, monitoring drug activity and interaction, evaluation of drug delivery systems, targeting and biodistribution, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, theranostics. A large part of the chapter will be thus dedicated to preclinical imaging acquisition in oncology but non-oncological applications will be also addressed. Data regarding the application of Artificial Intelligence to preclinical imaging analysis are also summarized.}

	abstract = {Background and aim: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly preferred over other more invasive modalities in preclinical studies using animal models. However, this technique has some limitations, mainly related to operator dependence. To overcome some of the current drawbacks, sophisticated data processing models are proposed, in particular artificial intelligence models based on deep learning (DL) networks. This systematic review aims to overview the application of DL algorithms in assisting US analysis of images acquired in in vivo preclinical studies on animal models.
	Methods: A literature search was conducted using the Scopus and PubMed databases. Studies published from January 2012 to November 2022 that developed DL models on US images acquired in preclinical/animal experimental scenarios were eligible for inclusion. This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines.
	Results: Fifty-six studies were enrolled and classified into five groups based on the anatomical district in which the DL models were used. Sixteen studies focused on the cardiovascular system and fourteen on the abdominal organs. Five studies applied DL networks to images of the musculoskeletal system and eight investigations involved the brain. Thirteen papers, grouped under a miscellaneous category, proposed heterogeneous applications adopting DL systems. Our analysis also highlighted that murine models were the most common animals used in in vivo studies applying DL to US imaging.
	Conclusion: DL techniques show great potential in terms of US images acquired in preclinical studies using animal models. However, in this scenario, these techniques are still in their early stages, and there is room for improvement, such as sample sizes, data preprocessing, and model interpretability.

	abstract = {A new approach for vascular super-resolution (SR) imaging using the erythrocytes as targets (SUper-Resolution ultrasound imaging of Erythrocytes (SURE) imaging) is described and investigated. SURE imaging does not require fragile contrast agent bubbles, making it possible to use the maximum allowable mechanical index (MI) for ultrasound scanning for an increased penetration depth. A synthetic aperture (SA) ultrasound sequence was employed with 12 virtual sources (VSs) using a 10-MHz GE L8-18i-D linear array hockey stick probe. The axial resolution was 1.20λ (185.0 μ m) and the lateral resolution was 1.50λ (231.3 μ m). Field IIpro simulations were conducted on 12.5- μ m radius vessel pairs with varying separations. A vessel pair with a separation of 70 μ m could be resolved, indicating a SURE image resolution below half a wavelength. A Verasonics research scanner was used for the in vivo experiments to scan the kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats for up to 46 s to visualize their microvasculature by processing from 0.1 up to 45 s of data for SURE imaging and for 46.8 s for SR imaging with a SonoVue contrast agent. Afterward, the renal vasculature was filled with the ex vivo micro-computed tomography (CT) contrast agent Microfil, excised, and scanned in a micro-CT scanner at both a 22.6- μ m voxel size for 11 h and for 20 h in a 5- μ m voxel size for validating the SURE images. Comparing the SURE and micro-CT images revealed that vessels with a diameter of 28 μ m, five times smaller than the ultrasound wavelength, could be detected, and the dense grid of microvessels in the full kidney was shown for scan times between 1 and 10 s. The vessel structure in the cortex was also similar to the SURE and SR images. Fourier ring correlation (FRC) indicated a resolution capability of 29 μ m. SURE images are acquired in seconds rather than minutes without any patient preparation or contrast injection, making the method translatable to clinical use.}

	abstract = {Chronic wounds are a major health problem that cause the medical infrastructure billions of dollars every year. Chronic wounds are often difficult to heal and cause significant discomfort. Although wound specialists have numerous therapeutic modalities at their disposal, tools that could three dimensional-map wound bed physiology and guide therapy do not exist. Visual cues are the current standard but are limited to surface assessment; clinicians rely on experience to predict response to therapy. Photoacoustic (PA) ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive, hybrid imaging modality that can solve these major limitations. PA relies on the contrast generated by haemoglobin in blood which allows it to map local angiogenesis, tissue perfusion and oxygen saturation-all critical parameters for wound healing. This work evaluates the use of PA-US to monitor angiogenesis and stratify patients responding versus not-responding to therapy. We imaged 19 patients with 22 wounds once a week for at least 3 weeks. Our findings suggest that PA imaging directly visualises angiogenesis. Patients responding to therapy showed clear signs of angiogenesis and an increased rate of PA increase (p = 0.002). These responders had a significant and negative correlation between PA intensity and wound size. Hypertension was correlated to impaired angiogenesis in non-responsive patients. The rate of PA increase and hence the rate of angiogenesis was able to predict healing times within 30 days from the start of monitoring (power = 88%, alpha = 0.05). This early response detection system could help inform management and treatment strategies while improving outcomes and reducing costs.}

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radiolabeled glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) is used to monitor atherosclerosis in clinical trials, but there is uncertainty regarding the plaque cell types that accumulate FDG and how uptake is regulated. The long-standing view that 18FDG is mainly taken up by macrophages is at odds with human and experimental data, and the impact of disease activity on 18FDG uptake has not been examined directly. To analyze the ability of 18FDG-PET to monitor disease activity, we developed a model of plaque regression in minipigs with hepatic overexpression of a gain-of-function mutant of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Atherosclerosis was induced through 12 months of high-fat feeding in the porcine model. Disease activity was then lowered for 3 months by reducing plasma cholesterol with a low-fat diet alone or in combination with the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor BMS-212122. Plaque regression in advanced lesions of the abdominal aorta was evident from reduced lipid content, reduced necrotic core size, and partial resolution of plaque inflammation and was accompanied by a decline in 18FDG-PET signal. Single-cell gene expression profiling revealed that plaque regression involved substantial down-regulation of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages, and lymphocytes, which was corroborated by analysis of the plaque cellular proteome. These findings in a large-animal model suggest that 18FDG-PET can monitor atherosclerosis because of a close association between disease activity and glycolytic enzyme expression in all of the major plaque cell types.}

Ultrasound has long been used for carotid atherosclerosis screening and plaque assessment due to its safety, low cost and non-invasive nature. However, conventional ultrasound techniques have limitations such as subjectivity, operator dependence, and low inter-observer agreement, leading to inconsistent and possibly inaccurate diagnoses. In recent years, a promising approach to address these limitations has emerged through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into ultrasound imaging. It was found that by training AI algorithms with large data sets of ultrasound images, the technology can learn to recognize specific characteristics and patterns associated with vulnerable plaques. This allows for a more objective and consistent assessment, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. This article reviews the application of AI in the field of diagnostic ultrasound, with a particular focus on carotid vulnerable plaques, and discusses the limitations and prospects of AI-assisted ultrasound. This review also provides a deeper understanding of the role of AI in diagnostic ultrasound and promotes more research in the field.}

The rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and thrombosis are major contributors to the development of acute cardiovascular events. Despite various advances in the treatment of atherosclerosis, there has been no satisfaction in the prevention and assessment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The identification and classification of vulnerable plaques at an early stage as well as research of new treatments remain a challenge and the ultimate goal in the management of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The specific morphological features of vulnerable plaques, including intraplaque hemorrhage, large lipid necrotic cores, thin fibrous caps, inflammation, and neovascularisation, make it possible to identify and characterize plaques with a variety of invasive and non-invasive imaging techniques. Notably, the development of novel ultrasound techniques has introduced the traditional assessment of plaque echogenicity and luminal stenosis to a deeper assessment of plaque composition and the molecular field. This review will discuss the advantages and limitations of five currently available ultrasound imaging modalities for assessing plaque vulnerability, based on the biological characteristics of the vulnerable plaque, and their value in terms of clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy assessment.}

Although several factors, such as maternal malnutrition and substance abuse, have been associated with offspring development, the mechanisms through which short- and long-term effects manifest in the fetus are not well understood. To this end, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using preclinical models has been a promising and underutilized technique for investigating fetal exposure and physiology in utero with minimal invasiveness. Herein, we review the application of PET imaging to fetal medicine and survey the limitations and opportunities for future longitudinal studies of development. Over the past two decades, several studies have utilized preclinical PET in quantitative studies of maternal-fetal exchange dynamics of pharmaceuticals, environmental toxins, or drugs of abuse. Another application has shown [18F]FDG PET to be a potential biomarker for fetal glucose transport, hypoxia, and brain function in utero. In contrast, only a few studies have employed reversibly binding radioligands to quantify protein markers of dopaminergic signaling and synaptic density in the fetal brain. As PET technology continues to improve, our review highlights a future role for PET in longitudinal studies of fetal health and development. }

We employed real-time, label-free multispectral photoacoustic tomography (PAT) to noninvasively assess cardiac development in mouse fetuses exposed to chronic alcohol. Using a custom-built PAT system, fetal hearts were imaged from E12 to E16 in alcohol-exposed (3 g/kg ethanol via oral gavage, n = 9) and control (n = 7) CD-1 mice. PAT enabled quantitative measurements of cardiac morphology, oxygen saturation (sO2), and heart rate. Alcohol-exposed fetuses exhibited consistently lower sO2 and greater heart rate variability, particularly at later gestational stages. While structural growth progressed in both groups, functional impairments became more pronounced with alcohol exposure. These findings suggest PAE alters fetal cardiovascular regulation despite normal anatomical development. This study highlights the utility of PAT as a high-resolution, noninvasive tool for monitoring fetal cardiac health and supports its potential application in developmental biology and prenatal diagnostics.}

Here, we present a strategy to investigate both stroke hemodynamics and stroke-induced functional alterations without the confounding effect of anesthesia, i.e., under awake condition. Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging was used to continuously monitor variations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in +65 brain regions/hemispheres for up to 3 hr after stroke onset. The focal cortical ischemia was induced using a chemo-thrombotic agent suited for permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in awake rats and followed by ipsi- and contralesional whiskers stimulation to investigate on the dynamic of the thalamocortical functions. Early (0–3 hr) and delayed (day 5) fUS recording enabled to characterize the features of the ischemia (location, CBV loss), spreading depolarizations (occurrence, amplitude) and functional alteration of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuits. Post-stroke thalamocortical functions were affected at both early and later time points (0–3 hr and 5 days) after stroke. Overall, our procedure facilitates early, continuous, and chronic assessments of hemodynamics and cerebral functions. When integrated with stroke studies or other pathological analyses, this approach seeks to enhance our comprehension of physiopathologies towards the development of pertinent therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {To improve the spatial resolution of power Doppler (PD) imaging, we explored null subtraction imaging (NSI) as an alternative beamforming technique to delay-and-sum (DAS). NSI is a nonlinear beamforming approach that uses three different apodizations on receive and incoherently sums the beamformed envelopes. NSI uses a null in the beam pattern to improve the lateral resolution, which we apply here for improving PD spatial resolution both with and without contrast microbubbles. In this study, we used NSI with three types of singular value decomposition (SVD)-based clutter filters and noise equalization to generate high-resolution PD images. An element sensitivity correction scheme was also proposed as a crucial component of NSI-based PD imaging. First, a microbubble trace experiment was performed to evaluate the resolution improvement of NSI-based PD over traditional DAS-based PD. Then, both contrast-enhanced and contrast free ultrasound PD images were generated from the scan of a rat brain. The cross-sectional profile of the microbubble traces and microvessels were plotted. FWHM was also estimated to provide a quantitative metric. Furthermore, iso-frequency curves were calculated to provide a resolution evaluation metric over the global field of view. Up to six-fold resolution improvement was demonstrated by the FWHM estimate and four-fold resolution improvement was demonstrated by the iso-frequency curve from the NSI-based PD microvessel images compared to microvessel images generated by traditional DAS-based beamforming. A resolvability of 39 μm was measured from the NSI-based PD microvessel image. The computational cost of NSI-based PD was only increased by 40 percent over the DAS-based PD.}}

Pathologies such as cancer, diabetes and arteriosclerosis can profoundly alter the microvasculature. Unfortunately, medical imaging modalities only provide indirect observation at this scale. Inspired by optical microscopy, ultrasound localization microscopy has bypassed the classic compromise between penetration and resolution in ultrasonic imaging. By localization of individual injected microbubbles and tracking of their displacement with a subwavelength resolution, vascular and velocity maps can be produced at the scale of the micrometer. Super-resolution ultrasound has also been performed through signal fluctuations with the same type of contrast agents, or through switching on and off nano-sized phase-change contrast agents. These techniques are now being applied pre-clinically and clinically for imaging of the microvasculature of the brain, kidney, skin, tumors and lymph nodes.}

Various groups now working on the subject are optimizing the localization precision, microbubble separation, acquisition time, tracking, and velocimetry to improve the capacity of ultrasound localization microscopy (Ulm) to detect and distinguish vessels much smaller than the wavelength. It has since been used in vivo in the brain, the kidney, and tumors.

	abstract = {The development of fully noninvasive, transcranial functional ultrasound (fUS) would increase the translatability and clinical potential of this neuroimaging modality. Unfortunately, transcranial fUS is hindered by skull-induced aberrations which degrade power Doppler image quality and lower sensitivity. As a result, a majority of fUS imaging studies rely on craniotomies or acoustically transparent cranial windows. To advance fUS technology further, we present an adaptive aberration correction method based on ray-tracing through 4 tissue layers (transducer lens, gel \&amp; skin, bone and brain tissue). Our method segments these layers, and estimates ultrasound wave speeds in each layer iteratively. Once a velocity model of the imaging plane of interest is retrieved, ultrafast power Doppler imaging of the brain is performed using a ray-tracing beamformer that accounts for wave refraction. We tested our method in three adult rats, and estimated wave speeds for the skin/gel layer (1628 {\textpm} 7 m/s), skull bone (3247 {\textpm} 110 m/s), and brain tissue (1526 {\textpm} 55 m/s). After aberration correction, we measured an average adult rat skull thickness of 388 {\textpm} 41 μm in agreement with anatomical records. The largest improvements in Doppler imaging quality were observed in cortical brain layers adjacent to the skull, specifically lateral spatial resolution was improved by 32\%. Our method consistently outperformed Doppler imaging based on traditional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, which assumes a uniform sound speed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Objective. Non-invasive imaging of the brain vascular system is key for the understanding and monitoring of cerebral small vessel disease and neurological disorders. ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is emerging as a powerful modality for the cerebral angiographic and hemodynamic imaging up to the microscopic scale in preclinical and clinical settings. However, the skull bone induces aberrations during ultrasonic propagation leading to distortions and shadowed regions. Approach. Here, we introduce an aberration correction method for ULM data able to extract the phase aberration from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of signals backscattered by microbubbles (MBs). Without any a priori knowledge, SVD processing extracts several correction time delays laws associated with different isoplanetic patches. To highlight the efficiency of this correction method, we first simulated the full ULM data pipeline numerically to characterize the impact of transcranial propagation on acoustic image reconstruction and then validated it on in vivo rodent data. The simulation generates synthetic backscattered signals from a rat vasculature mimicking model using real ULM position and velocity data acquired on a trepanned rat and virtually aberrated by ‘ground truth’ aberrators. Main results. The correction algorithm correctly retrieves this virtual aberration law in simulation. Then, applied to in vivo data, it improves image quality and enhance the number of detected MB for ULM imaging by up to 15%. Significance. This simple and fast correction method may open the way for a more widespread use of transcranial ULM in rodents and could be further extended to humans.}

	abstract={In a recent study, we proposed a technique to correct aberration caused by the skull and reconstruct a transcranial B-mode image with a refraction-corrected synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) scheme. Given a sound speed map, the arrival times were calculated using a fast marching technique (FMT), which solves the Eikonal equation and, therefore, is computationally expensive for real-time imaging. In this article, we introduce a two-point ray tracing method, based on Fermat’s principle, for fast calculation of the travel times in the presence of a layered aberrator in front of the ultrasound probe. The ray tracing method along with the reconstruction technique is implemented on a graphical processing unite (GPU). The point spread function (PSF) in a wire phantom image reconstructed with the FMT and the GPU implementation was studied with numerical synthetic data and experiments with a bone-mimicking plate and a sagittally cut human skull. The numerical analysis showed that the error on travel times is less than 10% of the ultrasound temporal period at 2.5 MHz. As a result, the lateral resolution was not significantly degraded compared with images reconstructed with FMT-calculated travel times. The results using the synthetic, bone-mimicking plate, and skull dataset showed that the GPU implementation causes a lateral/axial localization error of 0.10/0.20, 0.15/0.13, and 0.26/0.32 mm compared with a reference measurement (no aberrator in front of the ultrasound probe), respectively. For an imaging depth of 70 mm, the proposed GPU implementation allows reconstructing 19 frames/s with full synthetic aperture (96 transmission events) and 32 frames/s with multiangle plane wave imaging schemes (with 11 steering angles) for a pixel size of 200 μm . Finally, refraction-corrected power Doppler imaging is demonstrated with a string phantom and a bone-mimicking plate placed between the probe and the moving string. The proposed approach achieves a suitable frame rate for clinical scanning while maintaining the image quality.}
